climate-maps-frontend
=====================

This contains all the frontend web code. The site is assembled using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) but can be served by any variety of means given its static nature. Currently, [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) is chosen for the map display. Tiles are custom-generated.
